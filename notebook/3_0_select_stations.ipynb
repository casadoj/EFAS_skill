    "The objectives of this notebook are two:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To select a subset of study points in the catchment.\n",
    "* To count the number of flood events that occurred in the catchment during the period from 14-10-2020 and 31-12-2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "I consider a flood event each time that the discharge time series goes over the 5-year discharge return period, which is not the same as the number of timesteps at which discharge exceeds the threshod. For every exceeding period, we count one event, no matter if the event lasted 6 h or several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid that the correlation between river points affects the result of the EFAS notification skill assessment, I will try different procedures to select study points.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the study more comprehensible and to make sure that the data of the reporting points is correct, the whole notebook focuses on the Ebro River catchment.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tasks to do__:<br>\n",
    "* [x] Remove stations too close. \n",
    "    * [x] According to area increment between stations in the same river.\n",
    "    * [x] According to correlation between the discharge timeseries. From each pair of highly correlated stations one must be removed; the election of which one from the pair to remove is important!\n",
    "    * [x]\n",
    "    * [x] According to correlation only for highflows. I consider high flow when discharge exceeds the 1.5 return period\n",
    "    \n",
    "Possible solutions:\n",
    "* [x] Apply the correlation procedure event-wise, so that it doesn't eliminate the minor events\n",
    "* [x] Apply the correlation procedure to the subset of stations with some flood event, so that a station with no events does not remove a highly correlated station that in fact had events.\n",
    "* Change thresholds:\n",
    "    * [x] Increase the area increment threshold in order to remove more stations, hence, reduce correlation.\n",
    "    * [x] Increase the correlation threshold to be more restrictive and remove less stations.Possible solutions:\n",
